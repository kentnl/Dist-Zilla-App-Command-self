# NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::self - Build a distribution with a bootstrapped version of itself.

# VERSION

version 0.001004

# SYNOPSIS

This is a different approach to using `[Bootstrap::lib]` that absolves a distribution from needing to forcibly embed bootstrapping logic in `dist.ini`

    dzil self build

This is largely similar to using

    [Bootstrap::lib]
    try_built = 1

and doing

    dzil build && dzil build

And similar again to:

    dzil run bash -c "cd ../; dzil -I$BUILDDIR/lib dzil build"

Or whatever the magic is that @ETHER uses.

This also means that:

    dzil self release

Is something you can do.

# CAVEATS

The nature of this implies that your distribution will probably need an older generation of itself for the initial bootstrap.

That is to say:

    dzil build

Must work, and use `Generation.Previous` to build `Generation.Build`

    dzil self foo

Will call `dzil build` for you, to build `Generation.Build`, and then invoke

    dzil foo

To use `Generation.Build` to build `Generation.Next`

- `1. Generation.Previous`

    A previously installed incarnation of your dist.

- `2. Generation.Build`

    The iteration of building the distribution itself from source using `Generation.Previous`

- `3. Generation.Next`

    The iteration of building the distribution itself from source using `Generation.Build`
