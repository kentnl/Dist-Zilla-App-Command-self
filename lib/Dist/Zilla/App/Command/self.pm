=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::App::Command::self - Build a distribution with a bootstrapped version of itself.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001000

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a different approach to using C<[Bootstrap::lib]> that absolves a distribution from needing to forcibly embed bootstrapping logic in C<dist.ini>

  dzil self build

This is largely similar to using C<[Bootstrap::lib]> and doing

  dzil build && dzil build

And similar again to:

  dzil run bash -c "cd ../; dzil -I$BUILDDIR/lib dzil build" 

Or whatever the magic is that @ETHER uses.

This also means that:

  dzil self release

Is something you can do.

=head1 CAVEATS

The nature of this implies that your distribution will probably need an older generation of itself for the intial bootstrap.

That is to say:

  dzil build

Must work, and use C<Generation.Previous> to build C<Generation.Build>

  dzil self foo

Will call C<dzil build> for you, to build C<Generation.Build>, and then invoke

  dzil foo

To use C<Generation.Build> to build C<Generation.Next>

=over 4

=item C<1. Generation.Previous>

A previously installed incarnation of your dist.

=item C<2. Generation.Build>

The iteration of building the distribution itself from source using C<Generation.Previous>

=item C<3. Generation.Next>

The iteration of building the distribution itself from source using C<Generation.Build>
