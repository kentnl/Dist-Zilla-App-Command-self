NAME
    Dist::Zilla::App::Command::self - Build a distribution with a
    bootstrapped version of itself.

VERSION
    version 0.001002

SYNOPSIS
    This is a different approach to using "[Bootstrap::lib]" that absolves a
    distribution from needing to forcibly embed bootstrapping logic in
    "dist.ini"

      dzil self build

    This is largely similar to using

      [Bootstrap::lib]
      try_built = 1

    and doing

      dzil build && dzil build

    And similar again to:

      dzil run bash -c "cd ../; dzil -I$BUILDDIR/lib dzil build"

    Or whatever the magic is that @ETHER uses.

    This also means that:

      dzil self release

    Is something you can do.

CAVEATS
    The nature of this implies that your distribution will probably need an
    older generation of itself for the initial bootstrap.

    That is to say:

      dzil build

    Must work, and use "Generation.Previous" to build "Generation.Build"

      dzil self foo

    Will call "dzil build" for you, to build "Generation.Build", and then
    invoke

      dzil foo

    To use "Generation.Build" to build "Generation.Next"

    "1. Generation.Previous"
        A previously installed incarnation of your dist.

    "2. Generation.Build"
        The iteration of building the distribution itself from source using
        "Generation.Previous"

    "3. Generation.Next"
        The iteration of building the distribution itself from source using
        "Generation.Build"
